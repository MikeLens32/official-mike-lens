                With my deep love for fiction and movies you can say that I was bound to eventually pick a camera at some point. I made communications my major and absolutely loved the world media on almost every level and miniored in nonfiction film production. I picked up writing with my with the never ending revovling dooor of ideas.

                When getting to Concordia College in New York I had a lot of freedom to create my projects and picking up a camera changed my life forever. I got into photography and deeper into videography. I find myself writing pieces that speaks to people and wanted people to connect with my work in college. My writing style for my shorts share that same passion and I want to connect my pieces to programs to give solutions and not just list the issues.
